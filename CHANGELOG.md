# CHANGELOG

## Maintenance

### Trade Intelligence
- Signal quality enhancements: timeframe alignment score, signal freshness/decay with half-life, configurable confidence buckets, and richer explanations. Defaults remain backward compatible and analysis-only.
- Dashboard formatting utilities: table rows, terminal output with ANSI colors, Discord/Slack webhook payloads, summary statistics, and signal filtering helpers. Read-only formatters for integration with external systems.
