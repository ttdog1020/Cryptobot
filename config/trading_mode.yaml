# MODULE 24: Trading Mode Configuration
#
# Controls trading behavior across all runtime modes.
# This is the primary safety gate for live trading.

# Trading mode: monitor, paper, dry_run, live
# - monitor: No orders, only signal generation and logging
# - paper: Full simulation with PaperTrader (virtual fills)
# - dry_run: Uses exchange client but only logs orders (no network calls)
# - live: Real exchange orders (REQUIRES allow_live_trading=true)
mode: "paper"

# Default strategy to use
default_strategy: "scalping_ema_rsi"

# Live trading master gate
# MUST be set to true to enable live mode
# This is a hard safety requirement
allow_live_trading: false

# Global safety limits
# These apply to all trading modes (monitor excepted)

# Maximum daily loss as percentage of starting equity
# Trading will halt if this limit is exceeded
# Example: 0.02 = 2% maximum daily loss
max_daily_loss_pct: 0.02

# Maximum risk per trade as percentage of equity
# Should align with risk.json default_risk_per_trade
# Example: 0.01 = 1% risk per trade
max_risk_per_trade_pct: 0.01

# Maximum number of concurrent open trades
# Module 25: Set to 10 to match symbol count (one position per symbol max)
max_open_trades: 10

# Maximum total exposure as percentage of equity
# Sum of all open position values / equity
# Example: 0.2 = 20% of equity can be in open positions
max_exposure_pct: 0.20

# Kill switch environment variable name
# Set this environment variable to "1", "true", or "yes" to halt all trading
# Example (bash): export CRYPTOBOT_KILL_SWITCH=1
# Example (PowerShell): $env:CRYPTOBOT_KILL_SWITCH="1"
kill_switch_env_var: "CRYPTOBOT_KILL_SWITCH"

# Additional safety settings

# Require manual confirmation before entering live mode
require_live_confirmation: true

# Log all order decisions (even rejected ones)
log_all_decisions: true

# Halt on consecutive order failures
max_consecutive_failures: 3
